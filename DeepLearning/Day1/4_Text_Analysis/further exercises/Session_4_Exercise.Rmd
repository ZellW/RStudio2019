In this session we saw how to develop RNNs (and specifically LSTMs) for text classification.

## Identify scientfic discipline

Your challenge in this exercise is to identify the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB moview revies corpus. The data set can be found in keras using `dataset_imdb(num_words = 10000)` but I've saved a version in the data folder also.

You are tasked with building four different models:

1. A densely-connected model using one-hot encoding.
2. One that uses word embeddings.
3. One that uses an RNN.
4. One that uses an LSTM.

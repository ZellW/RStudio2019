If you completed the exercises in the first session, you've evaluated the Abalone data set as either a:

- Scalar Regression,
- Binary Classificaiton, or
- Single-label, Multi-class Classification

problem. That was just setting up and running a network. Let's see if we can evaluate our models and improe on them.


Here attempt to evaluate and improve on your results using some form of validation and a method to adjust for overfitting. Use one or more of the following methods:

- Reduce capacity
- Regularization
- Dropout

In the previous exercises you were only given 25% of the abalone data set. In the data directory you'll find from 10 to 100% of the data set. Now you can test the effects of increasing the dataset also.
